    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>I'm Ajay Zhimire—a researcher, data architect, and educator passionate about bridging finance, data science, and neuroscience. I hold an MBA and a Master's in Data Science, and I am currently pursuing a PhD in Finance, where I explore the intersection of machine learning, asset pricing, and behavioral decision-making.</p>
    <p>Professionally, I've spent nearly two decades at UnitedHealth Group, specializing in data architecture and cloud-enabled analytics, while my academic work focuses on questions such as: How does governance act as a priced risk factor? How do behavioral biases shape markets?</p>
    <p>This site is a space to share research, essays, and resources—and eventually expand into math and science tutoring, mentorship, and educational projects as part of my philanthropic interests. Beyond finance and data, I enjoy exploring music, neuroscience, astronomy, and hands-on experiments that spark curiosity and inspire learning.</p>
    <p>At my core, I'm a lifelong learner and a proud father of two, striving to be a role model who demonstrates that knowledge is not just studied—it's lived, shared, and applied.</p>
