      <h3>Revolutionary Life</h3>
      <p>At 26, with no formal scientific training, Jane Goodall ventured into what is now Gombe Stream National
        Park in Tanzania. Her patient observations of chimpanzees revolutionized our understanding of what it
        means to be human. She discovered that chimpanzees make and use tools, have complex social relationships,
        and display emotions. These findings redefined humanity itself.</p>
