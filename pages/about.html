    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I began my PhD as a hobby. It soon grew into a passion for knowledge and self-learning. For me, learning is a way to keep pace with social and technological change while exploring what it means to be human.</p>
    <p>I'm fascinated by the human mind, its choices, behaviors, short term and long term memory storage. </p>
    <p>
      I work as a data architect professionally and research the intersection of technology and human behavior. My first research is asset-pricing and behavioral finance, rational vs irrational decision making.</p>
    <p>I will share essays, blogs discussion threads and reflections drawn from both lived and learned experiences.</p>

    <p>
      I hope to see you around!
